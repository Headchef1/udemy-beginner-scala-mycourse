  /*
    1. overload the + operator which receives a String and will return new person with a nickname
        mary + "the rockstar" => new person "Mary (the rockstar)"

    2. Add an age tÑ‰ the Person class with default 0 value, if we want
        Add a unary + operator => new person with the afe + 1
        +mary = > mary with the age incrementer

    3. Add a "learns" method in the Person class, receives a String parameter => "Mary learns Scala"
        Add a learnsScala method, calls learns method with "Scala"
        Use it in postfix notation.

    4. Overload the apply method to receive a number and returns a String
        mary.apply(2) => "Mary watched Inception 2 times"
